# Identicon

This proyect is part of Udemys Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp. This module focused around building an Identicon generator. Identicons are the images displayed in some sites (for example GitHub) when users don't upload their own profile pic. Identicons are always the same if the same input string (name for example) is provided.

### To run:
```
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
iex(1)> Identicon.main("my_name")
```
